1.d4 d5
2.c4 dxc4
3.e3 ...

Here White is maybe hoping that Black would like that he hangs on the c4 pawn. But that pawn is lost, and the good player with White should know that. Indeed 3....b5 runs into Qf3 ideas. And if not, into 4.a4 

## 3.Bxc4...
After 3....exd4 cxd4, we just have a normal game of chess. White has an isolated pawn but a better grip on the center. Black should simply develop with Bd6 etc.
