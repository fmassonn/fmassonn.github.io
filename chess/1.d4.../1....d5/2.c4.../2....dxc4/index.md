# The Queen's gambit accepted

1.d4 d5
2.c4 dxc4

## Black's point of view

By taking on c4, Black steers the rest of the beginning of the opening and forces White to one first mission (taking back on c4) that can divert him from the general opening goal (prepare a playable middle game).


Black should never forget that he is a pawn up, so he can concede one pawn while getting sort of advantage at the same time.

Black is going to have the same response against all of White's moves except 3.Nf3: 3...e5

Black should be aware that his castling might be at risk. Black should also be extremely careful about White's Qa4+ ideas.
