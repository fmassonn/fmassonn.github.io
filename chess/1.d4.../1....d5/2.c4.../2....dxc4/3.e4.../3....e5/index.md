# The McDonnell Defense

1.d4 d5
2.c4 dxc4
3.e4 e5

## Best continuations

### 4.Nf3...
**Why?** White continues development. Other moves lead to a more neutral game (see below)

## Other continuations
### 4.Qxd4
With this move, Black can force 4.exd4 and manage to attract the knight to d4, where it will become a target of his dark square bishop, winning tempi on the knight.
### 4.Nxd4
Same as above

### 4.d5...
This is an imprecise move. Black can now hang on his c4 pawn via 4....b5, or continue quick development through 4....Nf6. In the last line, pay attention to 5.Nc3 Bb4?? 6.Qa4+
