# Normal Variation
1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 Nf6
4.Ng5 d5

Here 5.exd5... is the only move that makes sense since the bishop is attacked.


## 5....Na5: the *Polerio Defense*
**Why** The knight counter-attacks the bishop. This is the best move according to the engine.

[**Go to the Polerio Defense!**](./4....d5/NormalVariation.md)


## 5....Nd4

## 5....b5
This is a less known but great way to refute the Fried Liver Attack

## 5....Nxd5
This is considered a mistake as 6.Nxf7 leaves white with a serious advantage. There is no formal proof that black is mated, but in practice it is in White's advantage. The most challenging line is:

6....Kxf7 7.Qf3+ Ke6 8.Nc3 Nb4 9.0-0 c6 10.d4

and white has clearly a more healthy position (although computer says equal)

 Another possible initiative for white is 6.d4, which cause equally big problems for black.
