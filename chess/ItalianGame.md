# Italian Game

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 ...

There are two main responses from black: 3....Bc5 (the *Giuco Piano* or "Quiet Game", more positional)  and 3....Nf6 (the *Two Knights Defense*, more aggressive).

## 3....Bc5: *Giuco Piano* (54%)
**Why**: Black places his own (dark squre) bishop on an active square, targeting the f2 pawn. Black also prepares possible short castle.

## 3....Nf6: *Two Knights Defense* (42%)
**Why**: Black adds pressure on the e4 pawn (currently not defended) while developing a piece and preparing short castle. It also invites White to play 4.Ng5, the Fried Liver attack, with a lot of tactical flavor.

## Other responses

### 3....f6
This is a weak move. It opens Black king's diagonal. White's plan is now to attack the center and to place his king in safety, before attacking Black's position. White should quickly castle and open up the position with either 4.d4... 5.O-O or 4.O-O... 5.d4
