# The 6....Qa6 line

1.e4 d5
2.exd5 Qxd5
3.Nc3 Qa5
4.b4 Qxb4
5.Rb1 Qa5
6.Rb5 Qa6


Here White should continue simple development. Probably 7.d4 is slightly better as it creates an X-ray on the Queen. 7.Nf3 is also acceptable. 


## 7....c6
White just plays 7.d4 (7...cxb5 looses the queen with 8.Bxb5+).

## 7...Qe6+
