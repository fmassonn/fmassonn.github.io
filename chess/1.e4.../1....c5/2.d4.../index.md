# The Smith-Morra Gambit

1.e4 c5
2.d4

White offers a central pawn to Black (note that such an exchange, d-pawn for c-pawn, is classical in any Sicilian line) and hopes to capitalize on swift and dynamic development.

Here Black can transpose to one line of the French Defense by going 2....e6 (the Franco-Sicilian defense). However, this is likely not going to be seen much since human players are either Sicilian or French Defense ones.
