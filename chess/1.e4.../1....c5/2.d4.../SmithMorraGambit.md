# The Smith-Morra Gambit

1.e4 c5
2.d4...

## 2....cxd4 3.c3 dxc3 5.Nxc3
Here White offers a second pawn to be gained by the development of the c3 knight.

White's plan are simple: to develop quickly, target the f7 pawn to the extent of possible (with the bishop and/or the queen and/or the g1 knight). Controlling the c and d files with the rooks is also key. Castle king side. Queen goes on e2 (occasionally on b3 if black)

### 5....e6: the *Chicago defense*

Black prevents White's bishop to shine on the c4-f7 complex.

### 5....d6

That is a poor move as it just allows White to implement his plans.
