# Two Knights Defense

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 Nf6

Here White has a pawn attacked (e4) and has to decide (a) whether he holds on it or not, and (b) where he wants to put the cursor between quiet, animated, or wild continuations. Black's move Nf6 is an invitation (if not a provocation) to play 4.Ng5!

## 4.Ng5: The *Fried Liver Attack*
**Why**: White plays the same piece twice in the opening to directly target the weak f7 pawn of Black. This is a wild continuation with a lot of tactics.

## 4.d3: The *Modern Bishop opening*
**Why**: This simple move opens the way to White's light square bishop, consolidates the pawn chain on light squares. Simple and efficient, quiet and positional.

## 4.d4: The *Open* line
**Why**: White cracks open the center, and plans to castle quickly to put pressure on the black king.


## 4.Nc3: The *Four Knights*
**Why**: White develops his second knight to defend the e4 pawn. However this is not such a good choice, because after 4....Nxe4 5.Nxe4 d5, Black forks the bishop and the knight (6.Bd3 dxe4 7.Bxe4 Bd6 and black is very satisfied). After the count, White will have lost its central influence with the pawns. Note that 5.Bxf7+ Kxf7 6.Nxe4 restores material, but concedes the pair of bishops.

## Other responses

### 4.O-O
Not such a good move since White gives away a free pawn (e4) for no real compensation. Indeed if 4....Nxe4 5.Re1 or 5.Qe2, black can simply respond by 5....d5, a move that protects black knight on e4 and attacks the white bishop on c4.
