# The Polerio Defense

Now White can play to reasonable moves: checking with the bishop or protecting the bishop with a pawn

## 6.Bb5+: the *Bishop Check Line*

Here black has 6....Bd7 or 6....c6

If 6....c6 then 7.dxc6 bxc6 (note that 7....Nxc6 is also valid)
## 6.d3: the *Kieseritzky Variation*
Often followed by 6....h6
