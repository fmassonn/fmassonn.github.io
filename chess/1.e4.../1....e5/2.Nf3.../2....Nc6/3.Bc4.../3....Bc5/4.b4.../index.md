# The Evans Gambit

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 Bc5
4.b4 


It is important to understand the spirit of this gambit both for the White and Black players, as the idea behind it will govern the following moves.

The first thing to know is that this gambit is theoretical, and has been played in Master games (Kasparov - Anand, 1995) or in famous games (e.g., the Evergreen)

White's idea with this gambit is to (1) build a strong center (the sequence c3-d4 will be typical), (3) take space, and (3) develop quickly. The Evans gambit aims at providing White with decent attacking chances.

Black's ideas depend whether the gambit has been accepted or not. If it has, then Black should not loose time putting his king to safety and undermine White's changes. If Black manages to calm down White's frenziness, then he can play for a draw or a win.

## Main continuations

### 4....Bxb4: the *Evans Gambit Accepted*
Here White proceeds with 5.c3... and Black has three main responses

[**Go to 5...a5**](./4....Bxb4/5.c3.../5....a5/index.md)

[**Go to 5...c5**](./4....Bxb4/5.c3.../5....c5/index.md)

[**Go to 5...e7**](./4....Bxb4/5.c3.../5....e7/index.md)


## Other continuations

### 4....Nxb4
This is a variant of the Evans Gambit Accepted. After 5.c3, the knight will be forced to go back to c6, resulting in an Evan Gambit Accepted where the bishop has retreated to c5

Black can choose to decline the pawn offer by retreating

### 4....Bb6
Here, White should continue his plan, which is to take space.

[**Go to 4....Bb6**](./5.a4.../index.md)
