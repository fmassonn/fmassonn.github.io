# The Giuco Piano

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 Bc5

Here White can chose between prudent, quiet, animated, dynamic, aggressive or chaotic follow-ups (with a more positional or a more tactical flavor depending on what he likes most).

## Main continuations

### 4.d3: *Giuco Pianissimo*
**Why**: The name speaks for itself. A very prudent (boring?) development move that supports the e4 pawn and creates a solid pawn chain.

### 4.c3: *Main line*
**Why**: This move prepares the push 5.d4 to claim the center. It tells black that yes, there will be a fight for the center, and that White does not plan to fight half a battle

### 4.O-O
**Why**: This move prepares the push 5.d4 to claim the center. It tells black that yes, there will be a fight for the center, and that White does not plan to fight half a battle



### 4.b4: The *Evans Gambit*
**Why**: White choses to sacrifice a pawn for not short-term material return, but with the hope to accelerate development and to develop a highly dynamic position

## Other responses


### 4.d4: The *Italian Gambit*
**Why**: White sacrifices a pawn by placing it on a square that is defended three times.

### 4.Bxf7: The *Jerome Gambit*
**Why**: A rather dubious gambit that can work in very rapid games against low-rated players. Yet black should know the correct continuation but can emerge with an edge and shut down Black's wishful ideas in a couple of moves
