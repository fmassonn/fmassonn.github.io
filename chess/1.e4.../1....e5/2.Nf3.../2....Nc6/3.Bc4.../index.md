# Italian Game

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bc4 ...

There are two main responses from black: 3....Bc5 (the *Giuco Piano* or "Quiet Game", more positional)  and 3....Nf6 (the *Two Knights Defense*, more aggressive).

## Main continuations

### 3....Bc5: the *Giuco Piano* 
**Why**: Black places his own (dark squre) bishop on an active square, targeting the f2 pawn. Black also prepares possible short castle.

### 3....Nf6: *Two Knights Defense* 
**Why**: Black adds pressure on the e4 pawn (currently not defended) while developing a piece and preparing short castle. It also invites White to play 4.Ng5, the Fried Liver attack, with a lot of tactical flavor.

## Other continuations

### 3....f6
This is a weak move. It opens Black king's diagonal. White's plan is now to attack the center and to place his king in safety, before attacking Black's position. White should quickly castle and open up the position with either 4.d4... 5.O-O or 4.O-O... 5.d4

### 3....d6: the *Paris Defense*
This is a rather sad and unambitious continuation for Black. Nothing wrong here, but simply a lukewarm attitude. Black's dark square bishop is buried under its own pawn chain. Black is admittedly not down material but, strategically, he is losing influence on the center and might go out of the opening phase with a strategic down. Note that this weak response can lead to a Legal's mate.

Recommended move is 4.Nc3.
