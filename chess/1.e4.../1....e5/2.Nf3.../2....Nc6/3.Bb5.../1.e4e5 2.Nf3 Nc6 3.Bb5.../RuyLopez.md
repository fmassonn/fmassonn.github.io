# The Ruy Lopez

1.e4 e5
2.Nf3 Nc6
3.Bg5...


## 3....a6 4.Ba4 d6

## 3....a6 4.Bxc6 dxc6: the *Morphy Defense, Exchange Variation*

Note that 4.Bxc6 does not give the e5 pawn since 5....Qd4 wins e4  back. On 6.Nd3 Qxe4 7.Qe2 then Qxe2 uncastles the king. With the pair of bishops, Black is comfortable. Following with long castle and its smooth.

Black should re-capture with the d-pawn (normally one captures toward the center) to ensure the development of the light square bishop.

This opening gave rise to a strong imbalance. Black has doubled pawns but the pair of bishops. White has a lead of development but has conceded the light square bishop. His plans will revolve about being strong on black squares.
