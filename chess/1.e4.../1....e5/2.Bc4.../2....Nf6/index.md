# The Berlin Defense

1.e4 e5
2.Bc4 Nf6

White has now to decide whether he wants to defend the e4 pawn or not.

If 3.d4 is played and e4 is not defended, White decides to play the Urusov Gambit.



## Theoretical continuations

### 3.d3
Quiet

### 3.Nf3
Transposes to a Petrof -- don't do that if as White you played the Bishop to avoid the Petrof :-)

## Other continuations

### 3.Qf3
As usual, getting the Queen out too early in the game is not a fantastic idea. While this is not a losing move, this is a sub-optimal one that can cause White to loose its initial edge. Here Black can have two plans: either take control of the center with the pawns with 3....c6,  or  3....Bc5 4....Nc3 to accelerate development and start a Queen hunting after Nd4 at some point, that will fork the f3 and c2 squares.
