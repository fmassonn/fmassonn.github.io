# The Berlin Defense

1.e4 e5
2.Bc4 Nf6

White has now to decide whether he wants to defend the e4 pawn or not.

If 3.d4 is played and e4 is not defended, White decides to play the Urusov Gambit.



## Theoretical continuations

### 3.d3
Quiet

### 3.Nf3
Transposes to a Petrof -- don't do that if as White you played the Bishop to avoid the Petrof :-)

## Other continuations

### 3.Qf3
