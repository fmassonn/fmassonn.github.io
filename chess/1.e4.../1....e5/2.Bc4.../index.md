# The Bishop opening

1.e4 e5
2.Bc4

White disarms a possible Petrof from Black and develops the bishop on a square that it will land on almost invariably. Without much surprise, this opening often transposes to other lines, in particular the King's Gambit if White delays the Nf3 move.

This line is good for White in that he can choose to steer the game towards an aggressive and trappy configuration or to a quieter one.


Since White's 2.Bc4 creates no threat (unlike, for example, 2.Nf3), Black is free to choose between several moves.
