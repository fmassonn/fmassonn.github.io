# The Wayward Queen Attack
(Other names: Parham Attack, Danvers Opening, Patzer Opening)

1.e4 e5
2.Qh5...

## Best continuations

### 2....Nc6: the Main Line
**Why?** This move defends the e5 pawn under attack, develops a piece and controls the center

[**Go to the Main Line**](./2....Nc3/index.md)

### 2....Qe7
**Why?** This move defends the f7 pawn but blocks in the King's (dark square) bishop. This is a sensible computer move but to play as a human requires practice since development is not going to be as smooth as with 2....Nc6

## Other continuations
### 2....Nf6: the Kiddie Countergambit
**Why?** This move offers the e5 pawn for rapid development.
This is a viable line for black

### 2....g6
This is a blunder since after 3.Qxe5+, White takes the rook and is in a seat.
