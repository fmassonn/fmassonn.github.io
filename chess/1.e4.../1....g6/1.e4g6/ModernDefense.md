# The Modern Defense

1.e4 g6

Black gives away the center, but will try to strike on the queen side with c5 at some point

An important idea for White, against this kind of setups, is to build a solid a1-h8 diagonal, to dislodge the bishop with our own dark square bishop and the queen, and to launch an attack on the king side. Preferably, then, castle on queen side. It most likely will be a rat rate to mate the opponent's king.

If the opponent fianchettoes the other bishop, he will have lost too much time and weâ€™ll be able to strike in the center.

The general recommended continuation for White is to take as much space as possible, given that Black is willing to control the center remotely.


## 2.d4 Bg7

White: here there are few systems/plans to work against the setup of black. One is to play 3.Nc3 to prepare long-castle and launch an attack on the kingside. The other one is to play c3 (which takes the knight's most natural square but builds a solid pawn chain against Black's g7 bishop). White should not forget that Black has placed the bishop as a weapon, so removing the sting of it is a key idea.


[**Go to the c3 variation!**]()

### 3.c3 d6

#### 4.Bd3 e5
Here White can continue with Nf3 that maintains strong central presence.

### 3.Nc3: *Standard Line*
