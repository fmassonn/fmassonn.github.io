# The Falkbeer variation

1.e4 e5
2.Nc3 Nf6


Here White can either continue normal development with the Three Knights Game (3.Nf3), pursue with the Stanley variation (3.Bc4) or play the ambitious Vienna Gambit (3.f4)


## The Three Knights Game

## The Stanley variation

## 3.f4: the *Vienna Gambit*

This is not strictly speaking a gambit because taking on f4 leads to a slightly inferior position for Black (at least for no compensation)

### 3....exf4

[**Go to the Vienna Gambit accepted**](./3....Bc5/GiucoPiano.md)

### 3....Nc6

This is not quite a good response from black because 4.fxe5 Nxe5 5.d4 Ng6 6.e5 Ng8

### 3....d5: the *Main Line*

The main line of the Vienna gambit.
