# The Caro-Kann defense

1.e4 c6



White's more aggressive response is undoubtedly to play the two-knights defense attack. It does not really matter whether White starts with the f- or the c-knight.

# 2. Nf3...

## 2....d5 Nc3

## 2....d6
This is a rare but not wrong response. Black somehow shoots himself a bullet in the foot with not pursuing the whole point of 1...c6, which is to reinforce the center. White should simply place the second pawn on d4 and then develop the c-knight.
