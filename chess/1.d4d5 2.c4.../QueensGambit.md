# Queen's gambit
1.d4 d5
2.c4...

By playing d5, Black has stated that he is not going to let the center. There are three principal continuations here:

## 2....e6: The *Queen's gambit declined*

This line is full of theory and I do not want to devote it my time and efforts now.

## 2....dxc4: the *Queen's gambit accepted*

[**Go to the Queen's gambit accepted**](./2....dxc4/QueensGambitAccepted.md)

## 2....c6: the *Slav Defense*

Other moves:

## 2....Nf3

## 2....e5: the *Alapin Countergambit*
