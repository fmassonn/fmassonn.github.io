# The Queen's gambit accepted

1.d4 d5
2.c4 dxc4

By taking on c4, Black steers the rest of the beginning of the opening and forces White to one first mission (taking back on c4) that can divert him from the general opening goal (prepare a playable middle game).


Black should never forget that he is a pawn up, so he can concede one pawn while gettingsoem sort of advantage at the same time.

Black is going to have the same response against all of White's moves except 3.Nf3: 3...e5


## 3.Nc3...

### 3....e5
By counterattacking in the  center, Black opens up the position. He offers the pawn back but at the price of exchanging the Queens and taking space.


Black should be careful of White's Qa4+ ideas.


## 3.e3 e5
