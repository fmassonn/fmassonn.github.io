# Fried Liver Attack

With 3....Nf6, black has allowed aggressive play from white and has now to take responsibilities. The f7 pawn is attacked twice, and White threatens a fork on the queen and the rook. Black cannot move the pawn nor capture the attacking pieces, nor enhance the protection of f7. Black has several strategies to solve his short-term problems: (1) obstruct the range of the well-placed bishop on c4 by playing 4....d5 or counter-attack White's exposed king. In the mid-term, black wants to kick away the attacking pieces.

## 4....d5: the *Normal Variation* (+0.00)
**Why** The most principled move since this takes the center, opens the way for the bishop and obstructs the bishop while attacking it

## 4....Bc5: the *Traxler Counterattack* (+0.82)
**Why** This can become a devastating punishment for White if he does not know the theory. But careful responses by White might in the long run pay off.

## 4....Nxe4: the *Ponziani-Steinitz Gambit* (+1.18)
**Why** Black gobbles the e4 pawn but runs into problems if White plays the only good move, 5.Bxf7+. If White does not know this best response, then black can have a lot of fun.
