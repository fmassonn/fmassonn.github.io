# Open positions

Five PhD and post-doctoral positions are open on rapid sea ice changes, their drivers, their predictability, and their impacts at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain, Belgium)

As our planet faces unprecedented climate changes that manifest most evidently in polar regions, we are seeking five talented individuals to join us in researching the pressing questions that remain unanswered related to Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, with a focus on the climatic drivers that shape their variability at the seasonal to interannual time scale and on the long-lasting impacts of repeated sea ice anomalies on the polar and global environments.

Through three prestigious research programs, including the European Research Council, the Destination Earth Initiative, and Belgium’s Science Policy, you will have the opportunity to delve deep into the drivers, predictability, and impacts of extreme sea ice states and their representation in numerical models, from state-of-the-art coupled Earth System Models to kilometer-scale prototype digital twins currently under development.

At the Earth and Climate Center of UCLouvain, you will be part of a team with a long-standing reputation for excellence in polar research. With connections to high-level initiatives and projects at national, European, and international levels, you will have access to the latest research, technologies, and resources to significantly contribute to the expanding body of polar scientific knowledge.

A description of the five positions, as well as guidelines to apply, are available hereafter.
